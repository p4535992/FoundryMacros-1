# FoundryMacros

Mainly I create macros that are MidiQOL driven. 

Please take a look at the prereq modules for each one of them, as mentioned in the beginning of each macro.

Loadout requires no modules to function as it is made with the core functionality in mind. 


You can find my MidiQOL settings in the relevant file.
For the most part I create and test things under these settings.

If you have any issues with any macros you find around here, create an issue about it, taking care to:
1. Mention the Macro version used and what's wrong with it,
2. Describe steps to reproduce and
3. Attach your MidiQOL settings, if applicable.
